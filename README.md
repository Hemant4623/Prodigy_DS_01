Overview

This project presents a visual analysis of the Titanic dataset using Python. As part of my data science internship at Prodigy Infotech, I created bar charts and histograms to illustrate the distribution of various categorical and continuous variables, such as passenger ages and genders. These visualizations provide insights into the demographics of the Titanic passengers, helping to uncover patterns and trends in the data.

Features

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Utilized the Titanic dataset to extract relevant information.
Visualizations:
Age Distribution: A histogram showcasing the age distribution of passengers.
Gender Distribution: A bar chart depicting the number of male and female passengers.
Insights: Analysis and interpretation of the visualized data to identify key trends and patterns.
Tools and Libraries
Python: The programming language used for analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib: For creating the visualizations.

Conclusion

Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to preprocess data and create informative visualizations. These skills are crucial for data analysis, enabling us to derive meaningful insights from raw data. This task not only enhanced my technical capabilities but also provided a deeper understanding of the Titanic dataset and its underlying patterns.
